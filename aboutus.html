        Technology drives this universe and we are going to be a part of this difference that
        technology makes. Currently pursuing my Masters Degree at Florida State University and 
        want to achieve success in building Software Products. Blogging is needed for software
        professionals to keep themselves updated and track changes in new technologies in IT.
